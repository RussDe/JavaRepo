/**
 * In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is,
 * the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum).
 * Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself) i.e. Ïƒ1(n) = 2n.
